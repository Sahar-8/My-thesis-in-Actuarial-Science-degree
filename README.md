# Competition & Risk‑Taking in Iranian Insurance (2007–2017)

**Abstract**  
This master’s thesis examines how market competition (measured via the *Lerner index*) affects risk-taking (Z‑score and loss-ratio volatility) and solvency across 17 Iranian insurance firms. By applying **SUR**, **OLS‑PCSE**, and **quantile regression** to data from annual reports and balance sheets, the results support the **competition–fragility hypothesis**: higher competition correlates with increased risk and decreased stability. Other significant solvency drivers include firm size, capitalization, reinsurance, and diversification, with effects varying by solvency level. The conclusions provide important insights for insurance regulators and managers.
